For this short text, let’s assume the application is written in Python. Common steps in a CI setup for a Python project include linting, testing, and building. For linting, common tools include Pylint or Flake8. Testing is usually done with pytest, which provides a clean syntax and good plugin support. Poetry and setuptools are examples of building tools for Python, if the application needs to be built into a runnable software bundle. 

There are plenty of good alternatives to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions. GitLab CI/CD offers integrated pipelines directly tied to GitLab repositories, similar to GitHub Actions that are directly tied to GitHub repositories. CircleCI, on the other hand, provides a cloud-based solution with good scalability. 

Deciding between a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment depends on several factors. A self-hosted CI offers more control over resources and security, and is more flexible overall but it requires maintenance and knowledge on infrastructures. A cloud-based environment, on the other hand, reduces maintenance effort and scales automatically to the files. 

The decision would depend on the team’s budget, data security requirements, and deployment targets. If sensitive data or internal networks are involved, self-hosting could be better, but otherwise cloud-based CI is faster and easier to manage.
